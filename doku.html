        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese Name:</strong> ドクドクの実</p>
        <p><strong>Official English Name:</strong> Venom-Venom Fruit</p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Poison</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Debut:</strong> Chapter 528; Episode 425</p>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Paramecia</p>
        <p><strong>Current User:</strong> Magellan</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Doku Doku no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants the user the ability to produce and control different types of poison, as well as grants immunity to all forms of poison, making the user a Poison Human (毒人間, Doku Ningen?). It was eaten by Magellan. This ability is not to be confused with a Logia-type power, as the user cannot transform their body into poison.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>Doku (毒) means "poison" or "toxicant" in Japanese. Dokudokushī (毒々しい) means "poisonous/venomous/poisonous-looking". Also, dokudoku (どくどく) is an onomatopoeia meaning "gushingly/in a steady stream", which may be a nod to the (usually) liquid nature of the poison created by this fruit's power. In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, it is called the Venom-Venom Fruit.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>This Devil Fruit power allows the user to create and control a wide range of poisons that can vary in strength and form, ranging from a mild irritant to a strong paralyzing agent, to a deadly and highly-corrosive toxin. The user can produce these poisons in both liquid and gaseous states. They also become totally immune to any and all poisons, be it their own or an external toxin.</p>
        <p>The user can create massive amounts of liquid poison that they can shape into gigantic, monstrous entities, such as a hydra or a demon. A large amount of poison can also be used as a means of transportation, allowing the user to travel through it like a pneumatic tube. The user can also cover themselves with a thick layer of liquid poison, giving them a virtual suit of armor. Said armor does not offer much fortitude, but it does dissuade opponents from attacking the user directly for fear of being poisoned.</p>
        <p>The effects of the poisons used, however, can be cured using an antidote. However, the difficulty of this task depends on the poisons used; a single poison can be relatively simple to cure, but having an accumulation of multiple poisons can make the creation of an antidote a daunting, nigh-impossible task, often an excruciating process lasting multiple days. Furthermore, any careless attempts to cure the ailments brought upon by the poisoning can hasten the death of the victim.</p>
        <p>The most powerful poison the power can produce is a red-colored poison, which Magellan himself has stated is powerful enough to "destroy Impel Down itself". Not only is this poison more lethal and fast-acting than most, but it also spreads out from any surface it touches, literally "infecting" all objects in its wake, including stone.</p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>While the user is completely immune to poison and its negative effects, the user's body is not able to process or digest it. If the user consumes their own poison, the tainted food would affect the user's bowel movements. Magellan, in particular, likes to add poison to his food for flavor, which results in incessant diarrhea, causing him to spend approximately ten hours a day on the toilet. This is especially problematic as he is very fond of the poisoned food, disrupting his work and lifestyle.</p>
        <p>As another weakness, it is shown that fire has some neutralizing effect on the liquid poison the user makes. Certain materials, such as Mr. 3's wax, are also resistant to most of his poisons, though the special red poison is still able to penetrate it and even stone due to its corrosive properties.</p>
        <p>A mix of different poisons can mean near-certain death depending on the poisons used, but some people can be cured of the poison if their body's natural strength is pushed. In cases where the victim has survived the poison, either by sheer luck or by being put through an accelerated healing process, they may develop antibodies that make them greatly resistant to further poisoning. Additionally, the large amount of poison generated makes the user a threat to allies, and even nearby bystanders can start suffocating on the user's toxic breath if the user is careless while using their abilities.</p>
        <p>Other than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>The fruit's bestowed powers, as demonstrated by Magellan, have been used in a variety of ways. With the fruit's powers, Magellan is able to enjoy a poisoned meal without the risk of dying. Instead, the poison adds flavor to the food for him. The only problem with this, however, is that while the poisoned food will not kill him, it gives him a severe case of diarrhea. His level of diarrhea may be related to the amount of poison he consumes.</p>
        <p>When dealing with Hannyabal's antics or any complaints from others, Magellan often uses the simplest form of offense the Devil Fruit provides, his own breath turned into poison. With this, he simply breathes mild poison gas on his subordinates to put them back in line.</p>
        <p>When serious, Magellan can use the fruit's powers to attack by producing and manipulating poison from his body. With this, he can promptly exercise his authority on prisoners as their executioner. Magellan can simply poison someone by breathing or using a complex move.</p>
        <p>To prevent his enemies from escaping or to trap them, Magellan can use his liquid poison to create a wall to block the exits of a building. Any object used to break Magellan's poison door simply goes into the poison, which absorbs and dissolves it. However, Blackbeard could absorb the poison with his darkness, proving this blockade is not absolute.</p>
        <p>In battle, Magellan can coat himself in liquid poison to serve as armor, preventing any opponent from easily landing any direct physical attack without getting poisoned in the process. Despite being coated, Magellan has enough control over his powers to enable him to delicately handle small objects while in this state, as seen when he held a Baby Den Den Mushi close to his face with his armor active without harming it.</p>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <h3>Doku Doku no Mi Hydra</h3>
        <p>Hydra (毒竜ヒドラ, Hidora): Magellan's signature technique. After producing vast amounts of liquid purple-blue poison from his body, Magellan is able to manipulate it in the form of a liquid-like acidic kinetic construct three-headed dragon. It seems that it can even separate itself from Magellan to pursue escaping foes. Alternatively, he can produce liquid poison in the shape of a dragon head from his arm which can extend to attack a single opponent. With this creature, Magellan is able to engulf any opponent in deadly poison. The level of toxicity is so overwhelming that it causes the victim to dissolve. The poison affects the nervous system, paralyzing the victim and making them suffer excruciating pain until they die. This technique seems to be very infamous within the walls of Impel Down, as the prisoners all know and fear its name and properties. Fire seems to neutralize the liquid the Hydra is made of and prevents it from completely reforming. Should one of its heads be burned, it does not completely recover even when Magellan retracts the creature back into his body.</p>

        <h3>Venom Road</h3>
        <p>Venom Road (毒の道ベノムロード, Benomu Rōdo): While producing his Hydra, Magellan completely engulfs himself in the liquid poison. While engulfed, Magellan quickly travels within one of his Hydra's necks and out of its mouth to where he wants to go. Magellan has also used this for travel. This was first seen while battling against Luffy.</p>

        <h3>Chloro Ball</h3>
        <p>Chloro Ball (毒ガス弾クロロボール, Kurorobōru): After chewing and blowing up some of his poison much like bubble gum, Magellan spits a blue bubble at high speed towards an enemy. Upon impact, the bubble explodes and releases a cloud of poison gas. The gas acts like tear gas and causes severe sneezing and immobilizes the enemy and anyone else near the vicinity. The name comes from chlorobenzalmalononitrile, or CS tear gas.</p>

        <h3>Doku Fugu</h3>
        <p>Doku Fugu (毒フグ, Doku Fugu): Taking a deep breath, Magellan inflates his body slightly in order to withstand a physical blow. This is apparently strong enough to withstand against a Gear 2 attack. While in this stance, Magellan can blow poisonous liquid bubbles with similar properties to the Hydra. This technique is named after the poison blowfish and its defensive ability against predators.</p>

        <h3>Doku Gumo</h3>
        <p>Doku Gumo (毒ドク・雲グモ, Doku Gumo): Breathing out large amounts of his poisonous breath, Magellan creates a fog-like cover in an area. This poisonous fog not only blurs the sight of any opponent caught within it but also slowly weakens them by gradually robbing away their strength, eyesight, and hearing.</p>

        <h3>Venom Demon: Jigoku no Shinpan</h3>
        <p>Venom Demon: Jigoku no Shinpan (毒の巨兵ベノムデーモン 地獄の審判, Benomu Dēmon Jigoku no Shinpan): Magellan's ultimate attack. He produces an enormous amount of liquid poison, which he calls a "forbidden technique," and forms it into a massive devil-like entity that mimics his every movement. The poison liquid is crimson-colored and releases a noxious smoke. The poison made from this attack is so toxic that it affects even non-organic objects, spreading like a disease over everything that makes contact with it.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Magellan ate the fruit when he was a child, having accidentally killed a flower he was watering with his powers.</p>

        <h2>Anime and Manga Differences</h2>
        <p>In the anime, when Magellan deactivates his liquid poison armor, it seemed to instantly disappear, rather than ooze away. Similarly, the red poison also disappeared rather than retract into his body or ooze away.</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <p>When Magellan talks to himself, there is a little pun stated by Hannyabal in response. The Japanese word for soliloquy is dokuhaku (独白), with doku (独) meaning "alone". The doku part, however, as stated by Hannyabal, is replaced with a different doku (毒), meaning "poison".</p>
        <p>This Devil Fruit endows similar abilities to other powers in the series, such as the Gasu Gasu no Mi and the non-canon Noko Noko no Mi, which also manipulates poison. The fruit user's ability to both produce and resist poison is similar to Vinsmoke Reiju's ability to secrete poison in battle and to neutralize poisons she consumes.</p>
        <p>This fruit is one of the few Paramecia often confused as a Logia-type Devil Fruit, because it seemingly produces an "element". However, it is not a Logia because the user cannot transform into the said element, but rather just generate it. The Doku Doku no Mi is one of the most unique Paramecia Devil Fruits in the series, giving the user the unnatural ability to cover their entire body with poison constantly and also gain immunity to many melee attacks and all poisons.</p>
        <p>This is the first Devil Fruit so far in the series to be named and explained before its power is demonstrated.</p>
