        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese Name:</strong> モチモチの実</p>
        <p><strong>Official English Name:</strong> Mochi-Mochi Fruit</p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Mochi; Springy</p>
        <p><strong>Fruit Debut:</strong> One Piece Magazine Vol.14</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Debut:</strong> Chapter 863; Episode 833</p>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Special Paramecia</p>
        <p><strong>Current User:</strong> Charlotte Katakuri</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Mochi Mochi no Mi is a Special Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to create, control, and transform into mochi. It was eaten by Charlotte Katakuri.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>"Mochi" (餅, もち) is a Japanese rice cake made of short-grain, sticky, glutinous rice (mochigome): first soaked and steamed, then pounded into paste, and finally molded into desired shapes. Mochi cakes are traditional Japanese New Year's food and otherwise eaten year-round as various confectionery or cooked, savory dishes. Mochimochi (もちもち, モチモチ) is a Japanese onomatopoeia describing things (like mochi) that are springy, doughy, and chewy in texture.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Mochi Mochi no Mi is a round fruit with a creamy white color and the swirl pattern typical of all Devil Fruits. Towards its lower half, the fruit narrows down significantly as if pinched off, before widening to form a rounded, flattened foot, hence resembling a flat mochi cake that has swollen on top. Atop the fruit is a green stem with one swirly end.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>The user is given the ability to create, control, and turn any part of their body into mochi—specifically a thick, extremely viscous and stretchy, white-colored mochi paste—that they can manipulate as they please, including hardening it into different shapes. When coated with Armament Haki, the mochi becomes an effective blunt-force weapon and is capable of trapping people, even extremely strong ones, due to its sticky, stretchy nature. The latter is such that high-caliber gunfire is completely unable to pierce through it.</p>
        <p>Additionally, due to its high malleability, hardenability, and compatibility with Haki, the mochi can be formed into a wide variety of shapes, such as replicas of body parts (like fists or feet to strike with), large tendrils, or even spiked clubs, as well as walls and other, even more elaborate structures.</p>
        <p>Unique amongst the Paramecia class, this fruit's ability to transform the user into mochi is analogous to the properties of a Logia fruit. Thus, the user is invincible against attacks that are not imbued with Armament Haki, as any part of their body that is struck by an attack simply morphs into mochi that can reform after.</p>

        <h3>Awakening</h3>
        <p>As with all Devil Fruits, this one has the potential to be "awakened", which allows the user to turn inorganic material around them into mochi.</p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>However, the mochi loses some of its stickiness if a sufficient amount of liquid is applied to it, allowing a trapped opponent to somewhat try to escape. This was first seen when Jinbe used Fish-Man Karate to douse Katakuri's leg with black tea, freeing the trapped Luffy. Also, the mochi is edible, especially if the user is not actively controlling it, which can allow one with an incredible appetite, like Luffy, to eat their way through it if they are buried in it. This can be countered if the mochi is so hard it cannot be bitten.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Katakuri uses his fruit in combat and is capable of controlling large amounts of mochi with high precision. He has been shown extending his limbs using mochi for various tasks. He can extend his leg to form an extremely fast, large, tendril-like blunt weapon, imbuing it with Haki to harm the rubber-bodied Monkey D. Luffy, and at the same time, entrap him.</p>
        <p>Katakuri has used his Devil Fruit to create mochi earplugs in order to resist his mother's destructive scream, creating and distributing more of them to his siblings as well. The mochi can also be used to plug up cannons, causing them to explode when fired.</p>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Yanagi Mochi:</strong> Katakuri swings his leg upward and sprouts multiple long tendrils of mochi from it, giving it an appearance similar to a willow tree, the ends of the tendrils being shaped to mimic his foot and used to repeatedly stomp down on his opponent. This was first used against Luffy, but was only named the second time it was used. This is called Willow Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Mochi Tsuki:</strong> Katakuri, while holding his trident Mogura, tightly twists his mochi arm and then untwists it while thrusting the trident forward, creating a very powerful drilling stab. It was first used against Luffy, who barely managed to dodge it, causing the attack to instead hit a building and completely destroy it. It was later used against Luffy successfully, creating a massive, gaping wound on his torso. The name of this technique is a pun on mochitsuki (餅搗き), the traditional Japanese ceremony to prepare mochi by repeatedly pounding steamed rice with a mallet. This is called Mochi Thrust in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaku Mochi:</strong> Katakuri turns his arms and hands into mochi and compresses them until they acquire a square shape. He then hardens them with Armament Haki and punches his opponent. The compact, tight square shape of the fists results in attacks that are a lot stronger than a regular Haki-enhanced punch, enough to cause Luffy great pain when clashing fists with him. It was first used against two chefs. The name of the technique is a pun on kakumochi (角餅), prepackaged, rectangular-shaped hard mochi that must be toasted or grilled before being eaten. This is called Edged Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Y aki Mochi:</strong> Katakuri inflates his mochi forearm until the pressure causes it to explode, propelling his Haki-embedded fist at his target from a distance. The speed of the fist is so high that it catches on fire due to friction. It was first used against Monkey D. Luffy during their fight in the Mirro-World. Yakimochi (焼餅) is a form of grilled mochi. This is called Burning Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Zan Giri Mochi:</strong> Katakuri's strongest attack. He transforms into mochi in a circle shape and spins towards his opponent at immense speed. When he gets near enough, he transforms to normal and turns his right forearm into a massive spiked club of mochi, which is coated in Busoshoku and possibly Haoshoku, slamming it on his opponent. The forearm is also very sticky, preventing the enemy from escaping. This technique creates a massive crater upon impact. It was first used against Luffy during their fight in the Mirro-World. This is called Buzz Cut Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>

        <h3>Awakened Techniques</h3>
        <p><strong>Nagare Mochi:</strong> Using his awakened powers, Katakuri transforms the ground around him into mochi and uses it to capture his opponent from a distance. It was first used to capture Luffy. This is called Flowing Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Kagami Mochi:</strong> Using his awakened powers, Katakuri transforms nearby walls and ceilings into mochi and causes them to collapse on his opponent, burying them under a large pile of mochi. It was first used against Luffy. This is called Mirror Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Amadare Mochi:</strong> Using his awakened powers, Katakuri transforms nearby surfaces into multiple blunt-ended mochi tendrils. He then has them converge on his opponent with great force, attempting to crush them. This is called Rainfall Mochi in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Muso Donuts:</strong> Using his awakened powers, Katakuri summons tendrils of mochi from the ground and loops them into the shape of donuts. This is called Unstoppable Donuts in the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations.</p>
        <p><strong>Chikara Mochi:</strong> Katakuri summons Muso Donuts first, and then from the center of the Muso Donuts, a hardened mochi fist coated with Busoshoku strikes his opponent with tremendous force.
