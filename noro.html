        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese Name:</strong> ノリノリの実</p>
        <p><strong>Official English Name:</strong> Slow-Slow Fruit</p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Slowly; Sluggishly</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Debut:</strong> Chapter 864; Episode 827</p>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Paramecia</p>
        <p><strong>Current User:</strong> Foxy</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Noro Nori no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to emit beams which temporarily slow down their target, making the user a Noroma Human (ノロマ人間, Noroma Ningen, Viz: "Slowpoke Human"). It was eaten by Foxy the Silver Fox.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>"Noro noro" (ノロノロ) is the Japanese onomatopoeia for any slow or sluggish action. "Noroma" (ノロマ) is the Japanese word for "slowpoke." In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, it is called the Slow-Slow Fruit.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>The primary ability of the fruit is generating and emitting Noroma Photons (ノロマ光子, Noroma Kōshi, Viz: "Slowpoke Photons"; Funimation: "Slowmo Photons"), purple beams of light which, according to Foxy, are special particles not fully understood by science yet. Those particles slow down anything they hit for thirty seconds, be it people, objects, or even the space itself.</p>
        <p>In that amount of time, the user can do anything to the slowed down object. Even something as volatile as a cannonball, which is normally fast and explodes upon collision, can easily serve as a floating platform for anyone to stand on when slowed. When a person is hit by these beams and receives any number of strikes while slowed, the kinetic force of said strikes is released all at once when they return to their normal speed, making the attacks more damaging. With good enough timing, the user can set up various traps with slowed down hazards that then move normally after a while, using the thirty-second limitation to their advantage.</p>
        <p>Noroma photons, being beams of light, can be reflected by mirrors. This allows the user to create interesting attacks that can catch their opponent off guard. That being said, this property of the fruit's ability may be employed against the user themselves as well if the opponent obtains a mirror. The user is not immune to the effects of their own photons and will be slowed down if exposed to them. It is also implied that disabling the user's arms is enough to prevent them from shooting further beams.</p>
        <p>In the anime, the beams are shown to only slow down something roughly the size of the beam itself, such as it slowing down only a small fraction of a tidal wave and leaving the user vulnerable to the rest of it. Other than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Though not completely sure how the photons really work, Foxy uses the fruit's bestowed powers to aid him in cheating in the games of the Davy Back Fight. These range from him helping his pirate crew in winning races by slowing down their opponents, to slowing down his own opponents to immobilize them during battle. As Foxy supplements his abilities with various devices and contraptions, he has several ways of outsmarting his opponents by revealing new techniques.</p>
        <p>While the Devil Fruit powers aid Foxy in many ways, they unfortunately can be used against him if his opponent can make the beams be directed at him. This can be done either by reflecting the beams or forcibly making Foxy fire the beams at himself.</p>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Noro Noro Beam:</strong> Foxy's primary attack, wherein he shoots a beam of Noroma Photons at his target, slowing them down for thirty seconds. Depending on what was slowed down, Foxy can do all sorts of things while they are slowed down. This was first seen being used on Nami, Usopp, Robin, and the Taru Tiger in the Donut Race. In the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations, this attack is called Slow-Slow Beam.</p>
        <p><strong>Kyubi Rush:</strong> After slowing his opponent down with his Noro Noro Beam, Foxy delivers a flurry of punches to his opponent at a rapid speed . The actual punches are not particularly strong, and they do not initially affect the opponent. Rather, the damage accumulates and strikes the opponent all at once when the thirty seconds expire. Foxy often loops his voice during this attack, yelling out "Rush!" repeatedly while punching. This was first seen being used against Luffy. The name of this technique is derived from the mythological Kyubi no Kitsune (nine-tailed fox) of East Asian folklore, in nod to Foxy's fox motif. This is called Nine-Tails Rush in the Viz Manga and Nine-Tailed Rush in the Funimation dub.</p>
        <p><strong>Megaton Kyubi Rush:</strong> After slowing his opponent, Foxy delivers a series of punches as with Kyubi Rush, only harder, faster, and with more punches. This was first seen being used against Luffy. In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, it is named the Megaton Nine-Tails Rush.</p>
        <p><strong>Noro Noro Foxy Face Bombs:</strong> Foxy uses a cannon to fire several bombs shaped like his face towards an opponent and slows them all down with his Noro Noro Beam. While they are slowed down, Foxy can sneak alongside the bombs as they are moving. Hiding amongst the bombs, Foxy can get closer to an opponent and punch them while they are distracted by the sight of the moving bombs. The bombs then all explode at once in a massive blast after they regain normal speed. This was first seen being used against Luffy. In the Viz Manga, this is called Slow-Slow Foxy Face Bomb and in the Funimation dub, it is called Slow-Slow Foxy Face Bomb Cannon.</p>
        <p><strong>Mirror Racket:</strong> Foxy uses a hand-mirror to reflect his Noro Noro Beam towards his opponent. The name of this technique is derived from how Foxy uses the hand-mirror as a tennis racket.</p>
        <p><strong>Noro Marble Oni Coach:</strong> Foxy traps his opponent in a chamber with the Gorilla Puncher 13 coming towards them. At the same time, he reflects his Noro Noro Beams all over the chamber using its mirrored back wall and Mirror Racket. Even if his opponent manages to dodge all of the beams and punches, unless they think quickly, they will be eventually crushed against the back wall by the Gorilla Puncher. This was first seen being used against Luffy. In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, this is called Slowpoke Ball Demon Coach.</p>
        <p><strong>Noro Noro Beam Sword:</strong> Using a wooden sword hilt as a base, Foxy forms an extendable whip-like sword made of his Noroma photons. This weapon can create the same effect on the opponent as a Noro Noro Beam. However, instead of merely slowing down an opponent whole, it can slow down the specific part of an opponent's body that it strikes. This was first seen being used against Luffy. In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, this is called Slow-Slow Beam Sword.</p>

        <h2>Non-Canon Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Double Noro Noro Beam:</strong> Foxy fires two Noro Noro Beams simultaneously with both hands in different directions. He first used this on Luffy and Zoro in the fourth one-hour special, but Luffy dodged one and Zoro deflected the other with his sword and it hit Buggy instead. In the Funimation adaptations, this is called Double Slow-Slow Beam.</p>
        <p><strong>Senju Kannon Noro Noro Beam:</strong> After Foxy hops into a large, hollow bust of his own head covered in mirrors. When it begins spinning at a high velocity, he sticks his hand out from below and aims his Noro Noro Beam at a small mirror, which reflects the beam at the mirror ball's surface. This causes the beam to bounce off the spinning mirror in all directions and slowing everything around Foxy for 30 seconds. This was first seen used against the majority of the Straw Hat Pirates on Spa Island. In the Funimation subs, this is called Thousand-Armed Kannon, Slow-Slow Beam, while this is simply referred to as a new Slow-Slow Beam in the dub.</p>
        <p><strong>Mashi Mashi:</strong> Foxy fires multiple Noro Noro Beams at the same object, causing it to slow down to the point that it appears to have completely stopped for 30 seconds. This was first used to stop some Marine battleships' cannon fire in Adventure of Nebulandia.</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <p>The gesture Foxy makes with his hands when firing the beams resembles the gesture used to represent a fox.</p>
        <p>A fan asked what would happen if the incredibly slow moving Baroque Works agent, Mr. 4, were hit by one of Foxy's Noro Noro Beams. Oda demonstrated what would happen by pretending to be Mr. 4 saying, "Oh crap!!" after being hit by the beams, revealing that it would have the same effect on him, albeit making him much slower than he already is. The incredibly long message that Oda gave for demonstration was cut short (reading as "o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o.....").</p>
        <p>Because of the way Boa Hancock's Mero Mero Mellow technique resembles the Noro Noro Beam of Foxy, it was mistaken for this fruit's power by Luffy.</p>
        <p>In the Funimation dub, the Straw Hats call the Slow-Slow Beam the Do-Do Beam as an insult.</p>
