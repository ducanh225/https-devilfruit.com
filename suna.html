        <h2>Suna Suna no Mi</h2>
        <p>The Suna Suna no Mi is a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to create, control, and transform into sand at will, turning the user into a Sand Human (砂人間, Suna Ningen). It was eaten by Crocodile.</p>

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <li><strong>Japanese Name:</strong> スナスナの実</li>
        <li><strong>Official English Name:</strong> Sand-Sand Fruit</li>
        <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Sand</li>
        <li><strong>Fruit Debut:</strong> One Piece Magazine Vol.12</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Debut:</strong> Chapter 127; Episode 77</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Logia</li>
        <li><strong>Current User:</strong> Crocodile</li>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>Suna (砂) means "sand" in Japanese. In the VIZ manga, 4Kids, and Funimation dubs, it is called the Sand-Sand Fruit.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Suna Suna no Mi resembles a spherical tan barrel cactus with two stubby arms pointing upwards. The fruit has the typical swirl pattern on it and has a green T-shaped stem protruding from the top.</p>

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>This fruit's power allows its user to transform their body into sand, as well as create and control sand in large quantities. Once transformed into their element, the user can let physical attacks (without Armament Haki) and non-Seastone projectiles pass through their body to prevent harm, like most Logias, or fly by morphing their lower body into jets of flowing sand.</p>
        <p>Creating sand grants the user various offensive capabilities; they can create blades of sand, large sandstorms, and vortexes that trap opponents. These techniques are further strengthened in a desert setting, where sand is abundant.</p>
        <p>Besides basic elemental control, the fruit exhibits a unique ability: liquid absorption, allowing the user to dehydrate anything they touch, causing plants, animals, or people to suffer from dehydration. This ability also means the user is immune to cave-ins, as they can escape from underground by turning themselves and the solid rock around them into sand.</p>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>The main weakness of this Logia power is exposure to liquids: the user's sand turns solid when in contact with liquids, such as water or blood. This prevents the sand from dispersing and temporarily nullifies the user's intangibility. However, this aspect seems inconsistent regarding the type of liquid used.</p>
        <p>Other than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Crocodile claims to have mastered the Suna Suna no Mi to the point of perfection, being able to shape his sand into various weapon-like forms and turn into sand whenever attacked. He often calls the efforts of those who cannot injure him futile.</p>
        <p>Crocodile once stated to be invincible as long as he fights in a desert, taking advantage of the local environment to establish himself as a nearly unopposable force. He conspired to suppress any other potential sources of water that could be used against him, secretly drying local villages and towns through his sandstorms.</p>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <li><strong>Desert Spada:</strong> Crocodile forms his right hand into a loose blade of fast-moving sand and stabs it into the ground , extending it along the ground like a torpedo, splitting anything in its path, including the very ground itself, through extreme and focused erosion created by the sand blade, which is strong enough to slice a man in half. When he used this on top of King Cobra's palace, the attack also generated a static surge that ran with the blade, nearly hitting Luffy in the process. Spada is the Italian word for "sword". Similarly, Espada is Spanish and Portuguese for "sword". In the 4Kids dub, this attack is called Desert Dagger, and retains its original name in the Funimation dub. The literal kanji reading of the move is Sabaku no Houtou.

<li><strong>Desert Girasole:</strong> Crocodile creates another loose sand blade from his right hand with Desert Spada. Like Desert Spada, he stabs it into the ground causing the area in front of him to collapse. However, a giant pit of quicksand will be formed instead, with the sand being taken away by underground rivers (which he can detect). Anything caught in the pit will be sucked in and buried alive. This attack can only be done while in a desert terrain. Girasole is the Italian word for "sunflower". This attack retains its name in the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, and in the English version of One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush! (dubbed by 4Kids), this technique is called Desert Swamp. The kanji's literal reading is Sabaku no Himawari.

<li><strong>Barján:</strong> Crocodile swings his right arm forward while leaving a crescent shaped trail of sand behind it. Anything hit by that trail is instantly robbed of all moisture because of Crocodile's dehydration ability. Barján is Spanish for "Barchan", a crescent-shaped sand dune. This is called Crescent Cutlass in the VIZ manga, the Funimation adaptations, and the English version of One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush! and Desert Cutlass in the 4Kids dub. However, in later Funimation dubbed media, it retains the original name. The literal kanji reading is Mikazukigata Sakyuu, the Japanese term for a barchan (though it can be written with the "no" possessive particle in the middle as well). Mikazuki is one of the Japanese terms for a crescent moon.

<li><strong>Sables:</strong> Crocodile summons a massive tornado of sand and sends it on a rampage. Once this sandstorm grows large enough, not even he can stop it. A variation of it is seen when Crocodile attacks Puppu's crew: with himself as the epicenter, he makes a sandstorm that can suck the water out of living things and is apparently able to crack steel. Another usage is to send people flying with this technique, as he did with many pirates who interfered with his attempts to kill Whitebeard, as well as sending Jinbe and Monkey D. Luffy out of Admiral Akainu's range. Sable is French for "sand", so the term "Sables" can mean "Sands", but it can also refer to a "sandstorm". Sable is also Spanish for "saber". This attack retains its original name in the VIZ manga and Funimation dub. In the 4Kids dub, this is called Sandstorm. The literal kanji reading is Suna'arashi.

<li><strong>Ground Secco:</strong> Crocodile places his hand on the ground and uses his dehydration ability to dry out a huge area around him, turning it into a desert wasteland. When he does this, it also can cause the area around him to crumble and cave in, causing unfortunate foes to fall to their deaths. Secco is Italian for "dry", while it is Seco in Spanish and Portuguese. This attack is called Wasteland Tremor in the 4Kids dub. The literal kanji reading is Hiware.

<li><strong>Ground Death:</strong> An extremely strong version of Ground Secco. Crocodile not only dries up the ground, but anything and everything on it including people and even buildings, all of which is transformed into sand if it has steady contact with the ground. The speed at which things dry also seemingly increases. In the 4Kids dub, this attack is called Wasteland Cataclysm. The kanji's literal reading is Shinshoku Rinne.

<li><strong>Sables: Pesado:</strong> Crocodile gathers a swirling mass of extremely dense sand in his hand, then hurls it at his opponent, causing a massive shock wave upon impact. Sables is French for "sands" and pesado is Spanish and Portuguese for "heavy". This is called Sandstorm Burden in the English version of One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush! and Sandstorms in the 4Kids dub. The literal kanji reading is S una'arashi: Juu.

<li><strong>Desert la Spada:</strong> An altered version of Desert Spada. Crocodile now forms several solid blades with fan-shaped edges instead of one large blade made from sand. This is the only time Crocodile has formed solid objects out of sand, although a sufficiently powerful blow will shatter it back into sand. In the eighth movie, rather than being four solid blades, this move is more like two buzz-saw like blades that are less solid. This attack is simply called Desert Spada in the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, Desert Slasher in the 4Kids dub, and Desert Rapier in the English version of One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush!. This attack keeps its name in the Funimation version of Movie 8. The word la in Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, and Spanish is usually a particle for "the". The literal kanji reading is Sabaku no Kongou Houtou.

<li><strong>Desert Grande Espada:</strong> An altered and enhanced version of Desert Spada. While Desert Spada forms a long underground blade of sand that slices everything in its path, Desert Grande Spada slices the enemy with a rising sand blade that erupts from the ground with greater speed, as not even Akainu was able to dodge it. It seems that this technique does not travel through the ground like Desert Spada, but comes from a specific point of it, as he used it on Aokiji's ice field (Crocodile's sand powers become useless when in contact with any form of water). It was first seen used to slice Akainu in half to protect Jinbe and Luffy. This move was not named when Crocodile first used it, but it was named in the game One Piece: Gigant Battle. Grande is Italian, Spanish, French, and Portuguese for "large", "great", or "big". The literal kanji reading is Sabaku no Taiken.

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The color of the sand changed in the anime, from a full light brown to a grayish light brown.</p>
<p>Long after the Arabasta Arc, where the fruit's power was fully explained, a fan once asked Oda in SBS about Crocodile's weakness to water, concerning how he bathes and how it affects him. However, Oda explained that he would not worry about being attacked in the shower and would take them anyways.</p>
<p>Ground Secco and Ground Death function similarly to the Awakening abilities displayed by Donquixote Doflamingo and Charlotte Katakuri, as it is activated by placing the hand on the ground and it affects the whole surrounding area.</p>
<p>Its ability to drain opponents of liquid and leave them as husks is similar to the powers of the Shibo Shibo no Mi and Mori Mori no Mi.</p>
