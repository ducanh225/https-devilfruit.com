        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese Name:</strong> ニキュニキュの実</p>
        <p><strong>Official English Name:</strong> Paw-Paw Fruit</p>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Paw</p>
        <p><strong>Fruit Debut:</strong> Chapter 1096</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Debut:</strong> Chapter 473; Episode 368</p>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Paramecia</p>
        <p><strong>Current User:</strong> Bartholomew Kuma</p>
        <p><strong>S-Bear:</strong> Artificial</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Nikyu Nikyu no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants the ability to repel anything via paws permanently manifested on the user's palms, making the user a Paw Human (肉球人間, Nikukyū Ningen, English version: "Paw-Palmed Human"). It was a treasure of the World Nobles before it was stolen and eaten by Bartholomew Kuma. This fruit's abilities were duplicated in the Seraph S-Bear, via a transfusion of Green Blood.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The fruit's name, Nikyu, comes from the word nikukyū (肉球), which means "pad" in Japanese. In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, it is called the Paw-Paw Fruit.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Nikyu Nikyu no Mi is a round fruit shaped like a three-digit paw print, matching the paw motif of the fruit's ability. It has a simple T-shaped stem that is curled on one end.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>The user is given the ability to repel anything via invulnerable, five-digit paw pads on the user's palms. Anything that touches, or is touched, by the paws can be pushed away at will with variable (usually immense) speed and force, with this repellent effect requiring no actual pushing motion on the user's part. The paws are only present on the palms and not the feet.</p>
        <p>Almost anything can be affected by this ability and "sent flying" regardless of makeup: tangible materials like objects and people (even the ability user's own body), gases like air, completely immaterial targets like ghosts, and abstract targets such as pain, fatigue, illnesses, or even memories. Intangible targets (like air) are automatically encased in transparent, paw-shaped energy bubbles when repelled. If something innate to a living being is targeted (e.g., pain or memories), it will not be blown away far but instead pushed out as a bubble that maintains itself close-by, making it accessible to someone touching it.</p>
        <p>In combat, the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi's ability makes for a powerful defense, allowing the user to deflect any and all attacks aside (or back towards the attacker) so long as they move their hands in the way fast enough, their paws working like impenetrable shields. The user can also harness their ability for offensive maneuvers, such as repelling the very atmosphere around them at "lightspeed" to create paw-shaped shockwaves that can pierce almost anything.</p>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>While the ability user can deflect almost any physical attack, they may only do so with their bare hands. Thus, should their hands be otherwise occupied, obstructed, or not move fast enough, they will receive damage from an attack that could have otherwise been averted. However, this weakness can be compensated for if the user has other means of protecting their body, such as Kuma's transformation into a cyborg with stronger-than-steel armoring.</p>
        <p>While the ability user can fly to different islands, even across entirely different oceans, at unrivaled speeds, this method of travel is limited in some respects. Most notably, the ability user can send themselves or others only to those places that they have visited in the past, leaving them unable to aim for unknown coordinates. Additionally, landmarks may be in the way of a given flight trajectory, forcefully stopping a sent-away target from reaching their proper destination mid-travel.</p>
        <p>Also, it seems that it is much more difficult for the ability user to endure the long-distance flight if they are too physically exhausted, even to the point of making conventional travel by ship preferable. Otherwise, while the ability user can push out physical pain and suffering into a bubble, that bubble will eventually return to its source body unless it is absorbed into another person. A bubble storing copied memories will also vanish if touched, causing the duplicate memories to transfer over to the touching person.</p>
        <p>Aside from this, the user suffers the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Since his youth, Kuma has dedicated himself to using the powers he received from his Devil Fruit in order to save, heal, and free the oppressed. Because of Kuma's altruism and capability, Emporio Ivankov dubbed his friend as having the Hands of Liberation (解放の手, Kaihō no Te), while one enfeebled woman of the Sorbet Kingdom's populace, which would be "healed" by Kuma on a weekly basis, called his hands Miracle Hands (奇跡の手, Kiseki no Te).</p>
        <p>Despite Kuma's kind-heartedness, the combat potential of his ability is undeniable and evident from how he has been seen using it in the present. For attacks in particular, Kuma likes to target the very atmosphere to launch attacks which, when executed, leave paw-shaped imprints or holes in whatever lies in their path. He can also push a massive amount of air into a bubble with both his hands to compress down and create a "bomb" that, when released, causes massive devastation.</p>
        <p>Other people (and objects) that Kuma blows away also fly at incredible speeds, seeming to disappear into thin air. According to Sentomaru, a person sent away by Kuma will travel through the air for three days and three nights (although in practice, flight time seems to vary) inside a paw-shaped bubble that protects them from any and all obstacles in their path until they arrive at a location designated by Kuma.</p>
        <p>Kuma can also use his powers to push virtually anything out of another person's body, including the sensations of pain and fatigue. These sensations are then manifested into a red bubble resembling a paw. With this technique, the pain the original person suffered can be transferred to another through direct physical contact with the bubble.</p>

        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Pad Ho:</strong> Kuma repels the air around him at what he claims is lightspeed, sending a devastating shockwave (an air-containing paw bubble) toward his opponent at high speed. The shockwave can travel directly through the body of the victim and continue into the distance, leaving paw imprints (or outright holes) in its wake. This attack was first seen when it was used on members of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association. In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, this is called Pad Cannon.</p>
        <p><strong>Tsuppari Pad Ho:</strong> Kuma first plants both feet firmly on the ground by means of a sumo-style foot stomp. Then, throwing his palms forward multiple times, he fires a vast number of "pressure shots" at the enemy. This technique was first seen used against Roronoa Zoro. The way he pushes his palms forward and the stance he takes while performing this technique resemble those used commonly in sumo wrestling. In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, this is called Thrust Pad Cannon.</p>
        <p><strong>Puni:</strong> Kuma's basic defensive maneuver where he moves his hands to intercept, repel, and thus counter enemy attacks using his paw pads. This was first shown in the manga when Kuma used it to counter Zoro's Sanjuroku Pound Ho (and subsequently his sword blades directly). The move remains unnamed in the manga but is named in One Piece: Burning Blood.</p>
        <p><strong>Ursus Shock:</strong> A destructive attack where Kuma forms an enormous paw bubble in-between his outstretched arms, trapping a massive portion of air within. He then slowly compresses the air by repelling it over and over using his paws, causing the bubble to shrink rapidly. Once compact enough to fit between his hands, Kuma launches the compressed air bubble at his opponent(s), like a bomb. The force of such blast was strong enough to knock out most of Kuma's "enemies" on Thriller Bark, smash buildings, uproot trees, and shake the entire island-ship. In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, the attack is called Ursa Shock.</p>

        <h2>Non-Canon Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Kuma no Te:</strong> Kuma lands upon the ground from mid-air with great force. This sends a powerful shockwave that blows away the enemies around him. This technique was first used in Pirate Warriors 2.</p>

        <h2>S-Bear</h2>
        <p>S-Bear utilizes this ability bestowed by Green Blood in the same way as his genetic progenitor, Kuma, in providing high-speed travel and creating a compressed air bomb.</p>
        <p><strong>Ursus Shock:</strong> The same as Kuma's technique, S-Bear gathers air with his palms and compresses it into a giant bubble which resembles a paw-print. Once the bubble is compact enough to fit within his hands, he releases the compressed air and sends it toward his opponent. The air quickly decompresses, causing a massive explosion in the form of a bear paw. It was first used against CP0. In the VIZ manga and Crunchyroll adaptations, this is called Ursa Shock.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>38 years ago before the present, the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, under the power of the World Nobles, was offered as one of the prizes for their triennial contest, the Native Hunting Competition that would take place on God Valley. A young Bartholomew Kuma, one of the participating slaves of the game, volunteered along with fellow slave Ivankov to obtain one of those fruits. Taking advantage of the chaos caused by the conflict between the Rocks Pirates and the Roger Pirates, Kuma and Ivankov were able to sneak into the competition's central venue and obtain the fruits. Suddenly, Charlotte Linlin ambushed the boys and managed to take the Uo Uo no Mi for herself but was unable to steal the Nikyu Nikyu due to Kuma quickly eating it at Ivankov's encouragement. After confronting Jaygarcia Saturn and making his own intentions to save people with his new powers clear, Kuma was able to escape the island, but not before saving 500 other victims of the hunt.</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <p>In the anime, whenever Kuma uses Ursus Shock, a hum reminiscent of a bomb alert horn is used, which adds to the bomb-like usage of the attack. In SBS 59, a fan revealed that all the Straw Hats' Devil Fruits each have two numbers between one and ten, with 2 and 9 being the ones left out. Therefore, due to being the translation of the letters in "Nikyu Nikyu," this led to the belief that Kuma or someone with his power would later join or aid the Straw Hats. This is further implied when Oda tries to avoid commenting further on the discovery.</p>
        <p>This Devil Fruit has the largest range potential of all known Devil Fruit powers, being able to send people across the world. The technique where Kuma repels one's pain away from their body appears in Pirate Warriors 3 as a special attack named "Omae ni wa Jigoku o Miseru…" (「お前には地獄を見せる…」, "I Will Show You Hell..."), in which Kuma throws the damage he has received at enemies, healing himself in the process. It is implied through many video games that Kuma can push out his own pain and fatigue, allowing him to endure a match much longer than he normally would. It is unknown if this aspect will show up in canon or not.</p>
        <p>In One Piece: Burning Blood, Kuma's special attack Where would you like to travel? where he "teleports" someone to some faraway location acts as a one hit-KO when used on a single opponent. When fighting against a team of opponents, the attack will force the hit target to swap out. The Nikyu Nikyu no Mi is similar to Bonney's Toshi Toshi no Mi and Big Mom's Soru Soru no Mi, being able to extract and sublimate intangible aspects of a living target, making them tangible (Kuma with pain/fatigue and memories, Bonney with age, and Big Mom with souls).</p>
        <p>The presence of both the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu and the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi showing up together during the God Valley Incident may be a reference to a passage of Mencius Chapter Gaozi I: "魚，我所欲也；熊掌，亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍魚而取熊掌者也。生，亦我所欲也；義，亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。" (I like fish, and I also like bear's paws. If I cannot have the two together, I will let the fish go, and take the bear's paws. I like life, and I also like righteousness. If I cannot keep the two together, I will let life go, and choose righteousness.)</p>
